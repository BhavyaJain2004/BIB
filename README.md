## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Bank Management System locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Community Server) or access to a MongoDB Atlas instance.
* [Redis](https://redis.io/download/) (for local development)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git) # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd bank-management-system
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and configurations.

    ```dotenv
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string # e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/bankdb or your Atlas URI
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key # A strong, random string
    REDIS_URI=your_redis_connection_string # e.g., redis://127.0.0.1:6379
    # Add any other environment variables your project uses (e.g., for email services, etc.)
    ```
    * **MONGO_URI:** If using MongoDB Atlas, get your connection string from the Atlas dashboard.
    * **JWT_SECRET:** Generate a long, random string.
    * **REDIS_URI:** If running Redis locally, `redis://127.0.0.1:6379` is typical.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start MongoDB server:**
    Ensure your local MongoDB instance is running, or that your `MONGO_URI` points to an active Atlas cluster.

2.  **Start Redis server:**
    Ensure your local Redis instance is running, or that your `REDIS_URI` points to an active Redis instance.

3.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # OR
    yarn start
    ```
    The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: `http://localhost:5000`).

## Usage

Once the application is running:
1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured port).
2.  **Sign Up** as a new user to create your bank account.
3.  **Log In** using your newly created credentials.
4.  Explore the dashboard to **transfer funds**, **add funds**, **view balance**, and check your **transaction history**.
5.  Use the **View Profile** option to see your account details.
